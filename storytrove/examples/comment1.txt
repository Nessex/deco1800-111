Overall a solid enough story. The tension is evident all through, and the dialogue is more than passable. Some better pacing wouldn't go amiss - more paragraphs and less standalone lines, and perhaps more clarity in the ending. The author also seems unaware that Van Diemen's Land is Tasmania, not New Zealand.
