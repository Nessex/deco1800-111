The family was all there. Mum and Dad, Nan and Pop. Uncle Pete. Cousin Marge and her twins. All to see HIM off. Dave. The bright spark of the family was off to make his fortune in Van Diemen's Land. The bastard has them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"Tell us about the captain!" yells Dad for umpteenth time
"Don't know how you'll survive without your mum cooking your meals for you" says Nan
"Hope you stop over in Sydney, be a shame if you wore your hand down to the bone with all the " Pop starts before being silenced by Nan elbowing him in the ribs.
Everyone has something to say. Some joke or appraisal. Everyone except Mum, who is silently crying with a smile on her face. It's the perfect family scene.
And it's pathetic.
Not one of them can see through his bullshit. None of them can see him for the liar he is.
Except for me.
Everything he can do, I can do better. He hasn't achieved a god damn thing that I couldn't do twice as well. Even this - his "lucky break" trip to New Zealand should have been mine. It was my idea to enter, and just his stupid luck to win.
Well soon it wouldn't matter.
It would be six months before he'd be in a position to send a letter, and a year easy before anyone might suspect that he was missing. They might never realise. 
"No doubt he's found a lovely Kiwi girl" Mum'll cry and brag. Stupid bint.
But for now, I just had to wait. To play my part. Once the distraction was gone, I'll be on top.
"Hey don't forget to save me some seashells, big brother"
