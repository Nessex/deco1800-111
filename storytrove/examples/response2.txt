"It's political correctness gone mad!" yelled Professor Ludzt, the vein in his head an actually quite lovely shade of eggplant purple. Maybe I should take a photo to show the wife as a nursery idea. No, that would be inappropriate. Babies need nice, soothing colours. That's what the big book said, anyway.
"Are you even listening to me?" interrupted the professor.
"Of course Albert, and it's out of my hands," I said, adjusting my glasses up onto the bridge of my nose. "The school board are being very clear about this - we have to accept new students, regardless of their race, religion, or the fact that they're actually a living forest."
It was the fallout from last year's monumental case - State vs. Maple Forest. It had opened the floodgates of civil rights for trees. Everyone had an opinion on it too - some, like old Alby Ludzt here, were violently opposed. Some were making great efforts to extend the rights even further. There were some ambivalent people of course. People like me - too preoccupied with the colour of a nursery to care about the Green Thumb revolution. Oh that's not a bad idea. Green. Hmm. It might be a bit political. No, best not.
"Or I walk!" the professor shouted, apparently finishing what was quite a long rant. Whatever it was, I knew he wouldn't follow through. I just sighed.
"Go to bed, Albert" I told him.
The 70 year old man sulked out the room in a manner not dissimilar to how my upcoming child might do so in a decade and a bit. At least I assume. That's what the big book was warning me about.
Alone in my office, I gazed drearily out of the window. The twilight sky was like a violet sheet draped across the sky. Violet. Do babies like violet? I walk over to my desk and pull out the book. It's gonna be a long night.
